## Introduction
<p>
  Predicting stock prices is a cumbersome task as it does not follow any specific pattern. Changes in the stock prices are purely based on supply and demand during a period of time. In order to learn the specific characteristics of a stock price, we can use algorithm to identify these patterns. Using our website you can learn about various types of chart patterns and implement your knowledge by indentifying the patterns using the predict functionality which shows MACD graph of any stock in real time. The successful prediction of a stock's future price could yield a significant profit and that is the vision of our website in the future.
</p>

## Aim
<p> 
  To predict stock prices according to real-time data values fetched from API.
</p>

## Objective
<p>
  The main objective of this project is to develop a web application to teach differennt chart patterns and predict stock price based on real-time data using python.  
</p>

## Project Scope
<p>
  The project has a wide scope, as it is not intended to a particular organization. This project is going to teach users regarding stocks patterns and help in predicting the stock price using various indicators. Moreover it provides facility to its users.
